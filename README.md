# pysmtreader (Python based SMT Reader):

Python application to poll electric Smart Meter Texas from https://www.smartmetertexas.com

This application uses undocumented API for https://www.smartmetertexas.com.
Big thanks to https://github.com/keatontaylor/smartmetertexas-api for the API details. 

# What it does: 
It polls www.smartmetertexas.com to get electric meter reading every hour (can be configured to read maximum twice per hour as restricted by www.smartmetertexas.com). Once read it will send read data to Home Assistant (Read more details at https://www.home-assistant.io/) 

# How to use: 
Applicaton is available at Docker Hub and can be used in one of the two ways:
1. Docker

~~~
docker run -d -v ./config/:/config scadaguru/pysmtreader
~~~

2. Docker Compose

~~~
version: "3"
services:
    pysmtreader:
        container_name: pysmtreader
        image: scadaguru/pysmtreader
        volumes:
            - ./config/:/config
        restart: unless-stopped
~~~

    wait_interval_before_ondemand_read_minutes: 5
    force_first_read: False # if true it will attempt to read Smart Meter Texas, otherwise at poll_interval

home_assistant: # Home Assistant access details
    base_url: _REPLACE_ # your Home Assistant URL/IP, no slash (/) at the end for example: http://192.168.1.149:8123

    ha_entity: sensor.smt_reading # home assistnat entity name to be created
~~~

# What Data Sent to Home Assistant:
### current_state: Latest reading value
### prev_state: Previous reading value
### difference: This is computed difference from latest and previoud reading, so if you polling once an hour it is  hourly usage
### unit_of_measurement: KW
### odrusage: This is provided by smartmetertexas.com and most likely it is total since last day
### last_timestamp: Last read time in the format of 2020-05-27 14:30:01.674
